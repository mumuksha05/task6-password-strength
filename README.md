# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
The purpose of this task is to understand the principles of creating a strong password, evaluate different password complexities using online password strength checkers, and summarize best practices for password security.

## Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)

## Steps Performed
1. Created multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity.
2. Tested each password using online password strength checkers.
3. Recorded the scores, estimated crack time, and feedback from the tools.
4. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
5. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, phishing) and prevention methods.
6. Prepared a professional PDF report containing findings.

## Example Passwords Tested
| Password         | Score (%) | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| sunny123         | 22%       | Instant              | Too short, common word |
| Sunny@2025       | 58%       | 4 hours              | Add more length & symbols |
| S@feTyNet_99     | 84%       | 14 years             | Strong password, could be longer |
| W@terM!l0n_#786  | 95%       | 340 centuries        | Excellent – good mix of characters |
| 8u#RzT!cQp2Lx$   | 100%      | Trillions of years   | Very strong – random characters |

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words or common phrases.
- Use random combinations instead of predictable patterns.
- Never reuse passwords across accounts.
- Consider using a passphrase (e.g., Mango!River$Sky88).
- Use a password manager for secure storage.

## Common Password Attacks & Prevention
**Brute Force Attack** – Trying all combinations until the correct one is found.  
_Prevention:_ Long and complex passwords.

**Dictionary Attack** – Using lists of common words and variations.  
_Prevention:_ Avoid real words or predictable substitutions.

**Phishing** – Tricking users into revealing their password.  
_Prevention:_ Verify sites and avoid clicking suspicious links.

## Deliverables
- **PDF Report**: Detailed analysis and results of password strength evaluation.
- **README.md**: Documentation of the process and findings.
